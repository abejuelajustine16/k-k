<h3 style="color:Tomato;">The Awakening</h3>

<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">When I look back through my past awakening, I think that this particular awakening is one of the most interesting among all of my awakening. It all started on August 24 20XX.
</p>

<p style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">Willowbrook Middle School is a prestigious school field with wonderful and hardworking students and I Gabriel Wright is going to start my 3rd year of middle school. As I was walking towards the school I come across a familiar gate. This entrance to the school that I walked across many times now for the past 2 years of my middle school, I've never actually walk with someone whenever I'm walking towards school.</p>

<p style="color:yellow;">Well I'm somewhat of a loner so that makes sense, but I will make sure that I'm going to change that and start making memories of my middle school.</p>

<p style="color:orange;">"Your life is going to change drastically, but it's not going to be what you expect it to be" a voice ring out of my mind that I've never heard before seem</p>
